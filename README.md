# Requirements

To use the Pandora ( Pianobar ) skill you'll first need to install Pianobar and configure it to work with your account.  In the future we plan to allow configuration through home.mycroft.ai.

First install pianobar

```
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get -y install pianobar
```

Once you've been able to start Pianobar from the command line you should be able to have Mycroft start it by saying "Hey, Mycroft....play pandora"
